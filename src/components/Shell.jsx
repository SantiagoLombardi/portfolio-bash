In my free time, I like to explore new outdoor activities and pursue my interests in tech and music. I've also taken courses on web development, JavaScript, and React on the Coderhouse platform, which has helped me build a strong foundation in these areas.");

The Licenciatura is a university degree that focuses on deepening theoretical and practical knowledge in a specific area, in this case, in the field of computer science. On the other hand, the Profesorado is a teaching training program that will allow me to acquire skills and competencies to teach at the secondary and tertiary levels in the area of computer science. \n In addition to staying current with the latest developments in the field by regularly reading technology news and industry reports, I've also taken courses in web development, JavaScript, and React on the Coderhouse platform. Currently, I'm also taking a backend programming course on Coderhouse. While these courses have provided valuable supplementary knowledge, I find that my formal university education is the cornerstone of my technical expertise.");
